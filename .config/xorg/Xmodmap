! The essentially maps a standard keyboard
! from:
! Function | Control | Super | Alt | Space | Alt | Menu | Control
! to:
! Function | Super | Alt | Control | Space | Control | Alt | Super
! with also adding Caps Lock as an Alt key because
! no one uses the Caps Lock key.

! output taken from:
! xmodmap -pke | egrep '(Control|Super|Alt|Menu)'
! Use to set keycodes correctly below. List reordered to match
! keys from left to right.

!! Original key bindings:
! keycode  66 = CapsLock
! keycode  37 = Control_L NoSymbol Control_L
! keycode 133 = Super_L NoSymbol Super_L
! keycode  64 = Alt_L Meta_L Alt_L Meta_L
! keycode 108 = Alt_R Meta_R Alt_R Meta_R
! keycode 134 = Super_R NoSymbol Super_R
! keycode 135 = Menu
! keycode 105 = Control_R NoSymbol Control_R

! First clear all modifiers, caps lock & control
clear lock
clear control
clear mod1
clear mod4

keycode  66 = Alt_L Meta_L
keycode  37 = Super_L
keycode 133 = Alt_L Meta_L
keycode  64 = Control_L
keycode 108 = Control_R
keycode 134 = Alt_R Meta_R
keycode 135 = Alt_R Meta_R
keycode 105 = Super_R

! We need to set keycodes first, as some programs (emacs!) read
! the key names and seem to ignore what's below.
add mod1    = Alt_R Alt_L Meta_R Meta_L
add mod4    = Super_R Super_L Menu
add control = Control_R Control_L
